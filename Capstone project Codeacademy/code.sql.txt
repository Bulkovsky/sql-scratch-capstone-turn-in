TASK 1:

Counts number of campaigns -

SELECT COUNT (distinct utm_campaign)
FROM page_visits
;

Counts number of sources - 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT utm_source)
FROM page_visits
;

Shows which campaigns use which sources - 

SELECT DISTINCT utm_campaign, utm_source
FROM page_visits
;

TASK 2:

Shows what pages are on CoolTShirts.com - 

SELECT DISTINCT page_name
FROM page_visits
;

TASK 3:

Counts how many first touches each campaign is responsible for -
Used LEFT JOIN instead of JOIN because I think that showing 0 by the campaign name is
saying more than not showing campaign name at all.

WITH first_touch AS (
    SELECT user_id,
       min(timestamp) as first_touch_at
    FROM page_visits
    GROUP BY user_id)
SELECT utm_campaign, count (first_touch.first_touch_at)
FROM page_visits
LEFT JOIN first_touch
ON page_visits.user_id = first_touch.user_id
AND first_touch.first_touch_at = page_visits.timestamp
GROUP BY page_visits.utm_campaign;

TASK 4:

Counts number of last touches for each campaign -

WITH last_touch AS (
    SELECT user_id,
       max(timestamp) as last_touch_at
    FROM page_visits
    GROUP BY user_id)
SELECT pv.utm_campaign, count (distinct ft.last_touch_at) as 'Last_Touch_Amount'
FROM last_touch ft
JOIN page_visits pv
    ON ft.user_id = pv.user_id
    AND ft.last_touch_at = pv.timestamp
    group by pv.utm_campaign;

TASK 5: 

Counts number distinct users that visited page 4 - Purchase:

select count (distinct user_id) as 'Visits_on_4'
from page_visits
where page_name = '4 - purchase'
;

TASK 6:

Counts number of last touches for each campaign on page 4 - purchase.

WITH last_touch AS (
    SELECT user_id,
       max(timestamp) as last_touch_at
    FROM page_visits
    GROUP BY user_id)
SELECT pv.utm_campaign, count (distinct lt.last_touch_at) as 'Last_Touch_Amount'
FROM last_touch lt
JOIN page_visits pv
    ON lt.user_id = pv.user_id
    AND lt.last_touch_at = pv.timestamp
    WHERE pv.page_name = '4 - purchase'
    GROUP BY pv.utm_campaign;

ADDITIONAL QUERY USED IN TYPICAL USER JOURNEY

Counts number of users which visited each site to show user journey:

select count (user_id) as 'Landing_page'
from page_visits
where page_name = '1 - landing_page' 
;
select count (user_id) as 'Shopping_cart'
from page_visits
where page_name = '2 - shopping_cart'
;
select count (user_id) as 'Checkout'
from page_visits
where page_name = '3 - checkout'
;
select count (user_id) as 'Purchase'
from page_visits
where page_name = '4 - purchase'
;
